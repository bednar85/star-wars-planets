# Star Wars Planets Organizer

_based on the data from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_planets_and_moons)_

I took the data from this Wikipedia page, translated it into JSON, and made filterable based on what each planet appeared in. It can also handle multiple filter conditions at once.

I'll be working on adding search and sorting logic soon as well as filters based on each the title of each Film/TV Series.
