During the final days of the Clone Wars, the planet served as a stronghold of the Confederacy of Independent Systems and a hiding spot for its leaders, until they were all murdered by Anakin Skywalker, under orders from the newly-established Emperor Palpatine. It was also the location of the duel between Anakin and his former Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, which led to the former's transformation into Darth Vader. The planet later became the site of Vader's sanctuary, which at some point was unwillingly visited by a smuggler and her droid ZOE3, who restored the Bright Star, allowing the planet to slowly restore itself to its original form. During the final days of the conflict between the Resistance and the First Order, it also served as the battle site between a cult of Alazmec colonists from Winsit, sworn to protect the ruins of Vader's castle, and First Order forces led by Kylo Ren, who sought a Sith wayfinder hidden amongst the ruins."
